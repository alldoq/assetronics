## Vision & Mission

### Vision
**To become the world's leading platform for hardware asset lifecycle management, empowering companies to eliminate asset chaos and optimize hardware investments.**

### Mission
**We automate the complete hardware lifecycle—from procurement to retirement—seamlessly integrating with the tools companies already use, so teams can focus on growth instead of chasing laptops.**

---

## Problem & Opportunity

### The Problem

**Hardware chaos is a hidden drain on scaling companies.**

As companies grow from 50 to 500+ employees, they face an increasingly chaotic problem that most automation tools ignore: **managing physical hardware assets**.

**The Pain:**
- **Onboarding chaos:** New hires wait days or weeks for equipment. IT manually coordinates with HR, finance, and procurement across email, spreadsheets, and tickets.
- **Offboarding black hole:** Unreturned laptops cost $1,500-$3,000 each. CEOs find themselves chasing hardware instead of running the business.
- **No visibility:** Finance can't track asset depreciation. IT doesn't know what's in stock. Executives lack visibility into hardware spend.
- **Manual, siloed processes:** HR uses BambooHR, Finance uses NetSuite, IT uses ServiceNow—but nothing connects them for hardware lifecycle events.

**Quote from a CEO (233 employees):**
> "Payroll runs itself. Analytics too. Everything's automated except the part that touches real hardware. When someone joins or leaves, chaos starts. Somehow I'm the one asking if anyone's seen a MacBook. I'm the CEO. I'm not supposed to be chasing laptops."

### Market Size

**TAM (Total Addressable Market): $15B+**
- **Companies with 50-1,000 employees globally:** ~2 million companies
- **Average spend per company:** $300-$500/year (SaaS) + services
- **Hardware under management:** $500B+ in corporate IT hardware globally

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market): $3B**
- Focus on tech-forward companies (tech startups, SaaS, professional services)
- North America, Europe, APAC
- Companies already using HR tech (BambooHR, Workday) and finance tools (NetSuite, QuickBooks)

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): $150M** (5% of SAM in 5 years)
- Target: 10,000 customers at $15K ACV = $150M ARR

### Why Now?

1. **Remote work explosion:** Distributed teams make hardware tracking even harder. Shipping, returns, and visibility are critical.
2. **HR & Finance tech maturity:** Companies already use sophisticated tools for payroll, benefits, and accounting—but nothing for hardware.
3. **Integration APIs available:** Modern SaaS tools (Workday, NetSuite, BambooHR) have robust APIs, making integration feasible.
4. **Rising hardware costs:** MacBooks, monitors, and accessories cost $3K-$5K per employee. Companies can't afford loss and waste.
5. **Compliance pressure:** SOX, GDPR, and financial audits require accurate asset tracking.

## Solution Overview

### What is Assetronics?

**Assetronics is an intelligent hardware asset lifecycle management platform** that automates every step—from provisioning new hires to recovering assets from departing employees—while integrating seamlessly with existing HR, finance, IT, and communication systems.

### Core Value Propositions

**For IT Managers:**
- Automate hardware provisioning (no more manual coordination)
- Real-time inventory visibility (know where every device is)
- Eliminate asset loss (systematic return workflows)

**For Finance Controllers:**
- Accurate asset accounting (depreciation, book value)
- Automated purchase-to-pay workflows
- Audit-ready reports (SOX, GAAP compliance)

**For HR Operations:**
- Seamless onboarding/offboarding (hardware included)
- No manual checklists or spreadsheets
- Employee self-service for repairs and returns

**For Executives (CEO, CFO):**
- Visibility into hardware spend and ROI
- Reduce asset loss by 80%+ (proven with pilots)
- Scale operations without adding headcount

### Key Differentiators

**1. People-Centric Workflows**
Unlike generic asset management tools (built for warehouses), Assetronics is designed around **employee lifecycle events** (hire, transfer, termination). Hardware provisioning is automatic, triggered by HRIS events.

**2. Deep Integrations (50+)**
Out-of-the-box integrations with:
- **HRIS:** Workday, BambooHR, Rippling, Gusto
- **Finance:** NetSuite, QuickBooks, Xero, Sage Intacct
- **ITSM:** ServiceNow, Jira Service Management, Freshservice
- **MDM:** Jamf, Intune, Google Workspace
- **Communication:** Slack, Teams, email

**3. Financial Intelligence**
Assetronics isn't just an inventory tracker—it's a **financial system** that handles:
- Purchase orders and vendor management
- Fixed asset creation and depreciation (GAAP, IFRS, tax)
- Cost center allocation
- Budget forecasting

**4. Modern, Intuitive UX**
Built for 2025, not 2005. Slack-native approvals, mobile-first design, QR code scanning, real-time dashboards.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

**1. Snipe-IT (Open Source)**
- **Strengths:** Free, basic asset tracking
- **Weaknesses:** No integrations, manual data entry, limited workflows, self-hosted (IT overhead)
- **Positioning:** Assetronics is "Snipe-IT for modern companies"—automated, integrated, and hassle-free.

**2. Asset Panda**
- **Strengths:** Mobile app, barcode scanning, established (10+ years)
- **Weaknesses:** Weak integrations (especially HR/Finance), dated UI, not people-centric
- **Positioning:** Assetronics integrates deeply with HR/Finance; Asset Panda is generic asset tracking.

**3. Ivanti IT Asset Management**
- **Strengths:** Enterprise-grade, comprehensive ITAM suite
- **Weaknesses:** Complex, expensive ($20K-$100K+), slow implementation (6+ months), overkill for SMBs
- **Positioning:** Assetronics is modern, affordable, and fast to implement (weeks, not months).

**4. ServiceNow ITAM**
- **Strengths:** Powerful, integrated with ITSM
- **Weaknesses:** Requires ServiceNow platform (expensive), complex, not focused on hardware lifecycle
- **Positioning:** Assetronics is purpose-built for hardware lifecycle, not a generic ITSM add-on.

### Indirect Competitors

**HR Tech Platforms (BambooHR, Rippling):**
- These handle employee onboarding but don't manage physical assets.
- **Opportunity:** Partner with them or build integrations to extend their value.

**Finance/ERP Systems (NetSuite, QuickBooks):**
- Handle asset accounting but not operational lifecycle (assignments, returns).
- **Opportunity:** Position Assetronics as the operational layer that feeds into finance systems.
