IT Asset Management (ITAM) MVP Specification: The "Quick Win" BlueprintThis document outlines the minimum set of features required to launch a viable IT Asset Management system that solves key business pain points related to cost, accountability, and data quality. The focus is on automation to move beyond manual spreadsheets (a "better than Snipe-IT" approach).I. Data Discovery & Automated Inventory (Foundation of Data Trust)The purpose of this section is to eliminate human error by automating asset data collection.Feature NameCore FunctionalityMVP Value Delivered1. Endpoint Agent DiscoveryA small piece of software (an "agent") is installed on every corporate computer (laptops, desktops). This agent automatically collects and sends data: User Name, Machine Name, Serial Number, Operating System, and Last Connection Time.Provides real-time, trustworthy inventory for the most expensive physical assets, ensuring data is always current.2. Identity System Connection (API)Direct connection (via a secure "API" link) to the company's employee sign-in system (like Okta or Azure Active Directory).Essential for SaaS License Reclamation by identifying users and checking sign-in activity to track true software usage.3. Network ScannerAutomatically scans internal network ranges to find devices that don't have the agent installed, such as network printers, switches, and server infrastructure.Provides a complete map of the network and identifies potentially unmanaged (or "Shadow") hardware.II. Core Configuration Database (The Central Accountability Hub)This database must be the single, reliable source for all asset information.Feature NameCore FunctionalityMVP Value Delivered4. Basic Asset RecordStores and displays essential attributes for every piece of equipment: Unique Asset ID, Current Status (e.g., In Use, In Stock, Lost), Purchase Date, Warranty Expiration Date, and Initial Cost.Establishes the baseline for accountability and financial tracking, ensuring no device is forgotten.5. User-to-Asset LinkA mandatory and automated link that connects a single, unique employee ID to their primary assigned devices.Immediately answers the question: "Who has this laptop?"—a critical need for IT support and security.6. Simple License RepositoryA dedicated section to record the Vendor, Total Seats Purchased, and Annual Cost for the company's Top 5 most expensive software subscriptions.Provides the necessary metrics to begin the ROI calculation by tracking entitlement against usage (see feature 9).III. Automated Workflows & IntegrationsThese features ensure the system drives efficient business processes, rather than existing in a silo.Feature NameCore FunctionalityMVP Value Delivered7. Helpdesk Integration Hook (API)A secure communication link that allows the company's existing IT support ticketing system (the "helpdesk") to instantly pull the asset's information (user, model, history) when an employee submits a problem ticket.Speeds up IT Support by providing technicians with immediate context, reducing the time it takes to fix problems.8. Automated Status ChangeThe system automatically changes an asset's status when a condition is met (e.g., if a laptop's agent doesn't report in for 30 days, the status automatically changes to Off-network / At Risk).Automated Risk Management—helps flag potentially lost, stolen, or decommissioned equipment that requires investigation.IV. Reporting & Alerts (Delivering Measurable Value)These are the features that convert collected data into financial justification.Feature NameCore FunctionalityMVP Value Delivered9. License Reclamation Report (The ROI Driver)Generates a report showing all software licenses where the user is provisioned to use the software but has not logged in (zero usage) for a defined period (e.g., 90 days).Provides immediate, verifiable cost savings by identifying licenses that can be canceled or reallocated, justifying the MVP investment.10. Warranty Expiration AlertSends an automatic notification to the purchasing team 60 to 90 days before an asset's warranty period ends.Enables proactive purchasing decisions (upgrade/replace) and prevents unexpected repair costs after warranties expire.
